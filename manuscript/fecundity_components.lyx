\begin_layout Title
The contribution of seed size and number to local adaptation in 
\emph on
Arabidopsis thaliana
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
As populations adapt to their local environment, we expect selection to
 tune investment in different life history stages to maximise reproductive
 success.
 We large reciprocal transplants at two sites over five years we examined
 the extent to which components of fecundity contribute to local adaptation
 in 
\emph on
Arabidopsis thaliana
\emph default
.
 We found strong selection for both fruit number per plant and seed number
 per fruit.
 Fecundity components were strongly positively correlated with one another,
 as well as with survival,but we found no trade-off between fecundity and
 seed mass.
 QTL analyses found that fecundity components share a common genetic basis,
 and that both antagonistic and conditionally neutral allelic effects contribute
 to local adaptation.
 At both sites, the fittest individuals were able to invest in all fitness
 traits, suggesting that variation in fitness is driven primarily in differences
 in overall resource availability.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Local adaptation is the process by which populations evolve in response
 to the specific selection pressures in their native habitat 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "williams1966,kawecki2004conceptual"

\end_inset

.
 A crucial aspect of this process is tuning the investment of resources
 into different life-history stages to match local conditions, such as adult
 growth, offspring number and offspring size 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lack1947significance,stearns1992"

\end_inset

.
 Given that the amount of resources available is always finite, there must
 necessarily be trade-offs in the amount of resources which can be allocated
 to different traits, relected in negative correlations between fitness-related
 traits 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "stearns1992,roff2002life"

\end_inset

.
 Such trade-offs are a major selective force shaping variation in nature
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "hereford2009quantitative"

\end_inset

.
 One the other hand, when variation in overall resource availability is
 large, this can overwhelm variation in allocation strategy, leading to
 positive correlations between traits 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vannoordwijk1986"

\end_inset

.
 These two scenarios are important for local adaptation because they can
 either constrain or facilitate the response to local selection pressures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maximising reproductive output is vital for maximising evolutionary fitness.
 For plants, fecundity depends on the number of seeds produced, and this
 can be achieved by increasing fruit number or increasing seed number per
 fruit 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "silvertown1989paradox"

\end_inset

.
 Seed number is a highly plastic trait that can vary enormously in response
 to resource availability and abiotic pressures, even among individuals
 with identical genotypes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "puckridge1967competition,lloyd1987selection,sadras2007evolutionary"

\end_inset

.
 This predicts that selection should act to allow plants to optimally utilise
 the resources available to maximise total seed production.
 Studies of local adaptation in plants typically focus on either fruit productio
n or total seed production as a measure of fecundity (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "latta2009testing,hall2010local,fournier2011map,hancock2011adaptation,agren_genetic_2013"

\end_inset

), yet seed production per fruit has received relatively cursory attention
 (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "agren_reciprocal_2012,hall2006divergent"

\end_inset

).
 It is therefore unclear the extent to which different components of fecundity
 contribute to overall differences in reproductive success, nor whether
 they constrain or complement one another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Investment in fecundity may also show complex relationships with other fitness-r
elated traits.
 Energy allocated to reproduction reduces that available for investment
 in defence against parasites and predators, or abiotic stressors such as
 cold tolerance 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "stearns1992,roff2002life"

\end_inset

.
 In plants, growth depends on meristems, which can develop into either vegetativ
e or reproductive tissue.
 Since these outcomes are mutually exclusive, there is a necessary trade-off
 between reproduction and further growth 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "geber1990cost"

\end_inset

.
 Similarly, providing additional resources to offspring through increased
 seed size may increase the fitness of the offspring 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "venable1992size,leishman2000evolutionary"

\end_inset

.
 Comparisons across species have confirmed a negative correlation between
 seed mass and number 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "salisbury1942,moles2004seedling,moles2006seed,sera2004number"

\end_inset

.
 However, intraspecific variation in seed mass is dwarfed by variation in
 seed number 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "harper1970"

\end_inset

, and aside from crop species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gambin2010resource"

\end_inset

, no consistent positive or negative relationship has been found between
 seed size and number within populations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "silvertown1989paradox,venable1992size"

\end_inset

.
 Interactions between fitness traits will depend strongly on the environmental
 conditions, and need to be examined in the specific local context.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Important insight into the process of local adaptation can be gained by
 examining the genetic architecture underlying adapative traits 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "merila1999genetic,mauricio2001mapping"

\end_inset

.
 Firstly, information about the number and location of quantitative trait
 loci (QTL) with detectable effects on phenotypic variation can reveal the
 extent to which QTL for fitness-related traits are found in the same regions
 of the genome, and hence whether relationships between phenotypes share
 a common genetic basis.
 Secondly, the change in phenotype associated with alleles at these loci
 can be used to infer the genetic mechanisms that have contributed to trade-offs
 in fitness at the level of contributing loci.
 For example, are fitness differences driven by antagonistic pleiotropy,
 where the local allele is favoured and the non-local allele disfavoured?
 Alternatively, do we observe conditionally neutral effects, where local
 alleles confer an advantage in one environment, but have no effect at other
 sites 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kawecki2004conceptual,anderson2011evolutionary"

\end_inset

? Because allelic effects depend strongly on the environment it is essential
 to assess their contribution under field conditions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "anderson2013evolution"

\end_inset

.
 Reciprocal transplant experiments using mapping populations at the sites
 of origin are an excellent tool to investigate the architecture of local
 adaptation in situ.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study we investigate the adaptive significance and genetic basis
 of components of fecundity in 
\emph on
Arabidopsis thaliana
\emph default
.
 We carried out reciprocal transplant experiments using a large RIL population
 and the parental lines at the source sites in central Sweden and Italy
 over five years.
 Previous work has shown that the parental lines are locally adapted, and
 identified winter survival in Sweden and fruit production in Italy as major
 determinants of fitness 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "agren_reciprocal_2012"

\end_inset

.
 Although not the focus of their study, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "agren_reciprocal_2012"

\end_inset

 also presented preliminary data suggesting that the local genotype produced
 more seeds per fruit than the non-local genotype, and hence that fruit
 number alone is likely to be an underestimate of total fecundity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we explicitly examine the contribution of two components of fecundity,
 fruit number and seed number per fruit, to local adaptation.
 Specifically we ask: (1) what is the relative strength of selection acting
 on each trait? (2) Are there trade-offs between components of fecundity
 or (3) between fecundity and survival or seed size? (4) Do we find large-effect
 QTL for fecundity components, and do they share a common genetic architecture?
 Our results reveal that genetic variation in seed traits makes an important
 contribution to local adaptation though effects on fecundity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Materials and methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data collection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data on survival, fecundity and fitness are taken from experiments in 2010
 and 2011 described in detail by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "agren_genetic_2013"

\end_inset

.
 Briefly, we set up reciprocal transplant at sites at RÃ¶dÃ¥sen in central
 Sweden and Castelnuovo di Porto in central Italy 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "agren_reciprocal_2012"

\end_inset

.
 At each site, we transplanted seedlings of parental genotypes from both
 sites and 398 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from these parents
 in autumn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In each following Spring we scored plants for three fitness metrics used
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "agren_genetic_2013"

\end_inset

: (1) survival to reproduction, (2) number of fruits for per plant that
 survived to reproduction (a measure of fecundity), and (3) number of fruits
 per planted seedling (a measure of overall fitness).
 For subsequent analyses we used the mean of trait values across individuals
 of the same genotype.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At each site-year experiment we also collected a single mature but unopened
 fruit, from between 79 and 189 parental plants and between 1917 and 2359
 RIL plants.
 We stored seeds in paper envelopes at room temperature until counting.
 We subsequently counted and weighed all seeds per fruit on a Metler Toledo
 AT261 balance.
 We then calculated mean seed mass as the mass of all seeds in a fruit,
 divided by the total number of seeds.
 We estimated mean values for each line in each site-year experiment as
 the mean across all individuals of the same genotype.
 After excluding lines with fewer than three replicate individuals per line,
 we were able to estimate values for seed number per fruit and seed mass
 for between 340 and 389 RILs for each site-year experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also used these data to estimate proxies for total fecundity and total
 fitness.
 We estimated seed number per reproductive plant as the product of fruit
 number per plant and seed number per fruit.
 Likewise, we estimated seed number per planted seedling as the product
 of fruit number per planted seedling by fruit number per plant.
 Since we did not have data on seed number per fruit for all individuals
 for which data on fruit number was available, we instead multiplied line-mean
 seed number by individual fruit number values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data manipulations and all subsequent statistical analyses were performed
 in RStudio 0.99.1266 using R 3.3.1

\begin_layout Subsection
Fitness differences between parental lines
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To assess the relative impact of traits on adaptive differentiation we expressed
 differences in trait means between parental lines as the selective advantage
 of the local genotype.
 We calculated selection coefficients as 
\begin_inset Formula $s=1-w_{A}/w_{B}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{A}$
\end_inset

 is the fitness of the local genotype and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{B}$
\end_inset

 that of the non-local genotype 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gillespie2010population"

\end_inset

.
 We calculated selection coefficients for overall fitness in terms of both
 fruit number per seedling and seed number per seedling, reflecting fitness
 estimates excluding and including information on seed number.
 We also estimated selection coefficients for two components of fecundity
 (fruit number per reproductive plant and seed number per fruit) and survival.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We estimated confidence intervals around estimates of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 by parametric bootstrapping.
 We resampled the data for each experiment with replacement 1000 times and
 calculated selection coefficients for each bootstrap sample.
 We estimated 95% confidence intervals for each coefficient as the 25th
 and 975th quantiles of these values.
 We estimate two-tailed 
\emph on
p-
\emph default
values for the null hypothesis that there is no adaptive differentiation
 as the twice the proportion of bootstrap values overlapping zero.
 It is more difficult to determine whether selection coefficients for the
 two measures of overall fitness, fruit number per adult plant and seed
 number per adult plant, differ from one another because these estimates
 are based on common data on fruit number, and as such are not independent.
 Rather than perform a formal test, we instead simply asked whether the
 coefficient for seed number per adult plant was beyond the 95% confidence
 interval for the coefficient for fruit number per adult plant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Correlations between traits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To assess the strength of trade-offs among traits we calculate Spearman's
 rank correlation coefficient, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, between RIL means for each site-year combination.
 We examined relationships between three pairs of traits: (1) components
 of fecundity (fruit number per reproductive plant and seed number per fruit),
 (2) survival and fecundity (seed number per reproductive plant), and (3)
 fecundity and investment in offspring (seed number per reproductive plant
 and seed mass).
 We performed analyses for data for each site-year experiment separately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A small number of lines appeared to be outliers that showed consistently
 showed low fecundity, but unusually high seed mass (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:scatter-plots"

\end_inset

).
 To exclude the possibility that these lines could unduly inflate correlation
 coefficients we repeated the analyses for fecundity and offspring investment
 excluding lines with mean seed mass greater than 35mg.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
QTL mapping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used the R/qtl package in R to map QTL for four traits: seed mass fruit
 number per reproductive plant, seed number per fruit and seed number per
 reproductive plant 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "broman2009guide,r_core_team"

\end_inset

.
 We performed mapping for RIL mean data for each site-year experiment separately.
 We used Haleyâ€“Knott regression using genotype probabilities of the genetic
 markers and pseudomarkers in gaps >2 cM 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "haley1992simple"

\end_inset

.
 We performed a two-QTL scan of the genome with 10,000 permutations of the
 phenotypic data to determine 5% LOD-significance thresholds for inclusion
 of QTL and epistatic interactions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "broman2009guide"

\end_inset

.
 Based on these thresholds, we used R/qtl's automated stepwise model selection
 procedure to identify significant additive QTL and epistatic interactions.
 We first applied a quantile normal transformation to phenotypes before
 model selection.
 Finally we used ANOVA on untransformed data to fit the multiple QTL model
 and calculate effect sizes with respect to the Swedish allele, as well
 as the proportion of the total phenotypic variance explained by each locus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We considered QTL identified for different sites, years or traits to be
 map to the same genomic region if the maximum-likelihood estimate of their
 positions were within 2cM of each other, or if the 95% Bayesian credible
 intervals for these estimates overlapped.
 This approach simplifies interpretation of QTL results, but risks losing
 information about individual genuinely distinct, but nearby QTL.
 This can be justified via the principle of Occam's razor; it is unnecessary
 to posit a a model with two QTL if it does not explain the data any better
 than a model with a single QTL.
 To aid interpretation we also excluded 'poorly-defined' QTL whose credible
 intervals for QTL position were less than 1/4 the length of the shortest
 chromosome (15.2cM; 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "agren_genetic_2013"

\end_inset

) from further analysis, because such QTL provide little information about
 position.

At both sites and in both years the local genotype had significantly higher

 in all cases; figure

 This advantage was more than twice as strong in Italy (

\begin_layout Standard
At the Italian site the local advantage was reflected in significant selection
 through survival (

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.001$
\end_inset

 When information on seed number is included in estimates of overall fitness
 the advantage to the local genotype increased by

 in 2010 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta s=0.094$

 in 2011.
 In both years the estimate of selection for seed number per seedling did
 not overlap with the 95% confidence intervals for the estimate for fruit
 number per seedling.

 In 2011, we observed significant selection through survival (

\begin_layout Plain Layout
QTL locations for fruit number per plant (F), seed number per fruit (S)
 and seed number per plant (T) in Italy (red) and Sweden (blue).
 Chevrons show point estimates of QTL detected in individual years.
 Where positions are identical this is show with heavier chevrons.
 Direction of the chevrons indicate the direction of effect of the Swedish
 allele.

 In all but one case, effect sizes of loci identified in individual years
 within in each cluster were in the same direction at a single site.
 The exception is F5:1, where the Swedish allele was associated with a decrease
 in fruit number per plant in 2010, but with an increase in 2013 (figures

In the models of 19 QTL positions for data from all five years, 15, ten
 and twelve loci showed a significant allelic effect at one or both sites
 for fruit number per plant, seed number per fruit and seed number per plant
 respectively (figure

 Significant effects favour the local allele in all cases except for the
 effect of T3:1, for which the non-local allele is associated with increased
 fruit number per plant, and has no significant effect on seed number per
 fruit or per plant.
 We found seven loci (T1:3, T2:1, T2:2, T3:1, T3:3, T5:2 and T5:4) that
 showed evidence of a trade-off between sites for fruit number per plant,
 four for seed number per fruit (T1:5, T2:1, T5:2, T5:3 and T5:4) and six
 for seed number per plant (T1:3, T2:1, T2:2, T5:2, T5:3 and T5:3).

For four QTL clusters in Sweden (T1:3, T1:4, T3:2 and T5:3), the direction

 In all cases this was true in a single year only (figure S4).

 In all cases, the local alleles at these loci were associated with positive

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This study investigated natural genetic variation for fecundity and its
 components among wild accessions and a recombinant inbred line population
 of 
\emph on
A.
 thaliana
\emph default
.
 Our results show that differences in overall seed number per plant between
 local and non-local genotypes are driven by differences in both fruit number
 per plant and seed number per fruit.
 We found strong positive correlations between components of fecundity and
 between fecundity and survival to reproduction, traits that represent major
 components of overall fitness.
 Despite this, we found little constraint of seed mass on fecundity.
 Large-effect QTL for total fecundity could be explained by QTL associated
 with one or both components of fecundity.
 Local alleles tended to favour the local genotype, with positive effects
 acting through both fecundity components.
 Together, these results indicate that the process of local adaptation in
 
\emph on
A.
 thaliana 
\emph default
involves maximising fitness in many fitness traits, with little evidence
 of trade-offs between traits, and that these trends are reflected at the
 genetic level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found contrasting patterns of the contribution of fecundity to fitness
 at the two sites.
 In Italy, differences in fecundity explain most of the differences in fitness
 between parental lines (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:selection"

\end_inset

, see also 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "agren_reciprocal_2012"

\end_inset

).
 The advantage to the local genotype through fruit number per plant was
 approximately twice as large as that on seed number per fruit.
 Nevertheless, the mean selection of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{s}=0.37$
\end_inset

 through seed number per fruit represents strong selection, and is of similar
 magnitude to values compiled by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "endler1986"

\end_inset

 for fecundity traits in other systems.
 By including information on seed number we are able to explain a substantially
 greater fitness difference between the parents in all years in Italy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Sweden, differences in fecundity contribute considerably less to differences
 in fitness than do differences in survival to reproduction 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "agren_reciprocal_2012"

\end_inset

.
 This is reflected in only weak selection on fecundity components in Sweden,
 which in one case significantly favoured the non-local genotype.
 The relative importance of fecundity components varied between years, with
 fruit number per plant explaining overall fecundity differences in 2011
 and 2012, and seed number per fruit explaining fecundity differences in
 2010 and 2014.
 As such, information on seed number allowed us to detect fecundity diferences
 between the parents in two additional years, that would not have been found
 had we considered only fruit number per plant alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reproduction requires enormous investment in resources, and as such we would
 expect to find trade-offs between fecundity and other fitness traits.
 In fact, we found consistent positive relationships between fecundity component
s, and between fecundity and survival, regardless of site.
 This suggests that variation in fecundity between RILs is driven primarily
 by variation in the overall amounts of resources available to invest in
 all traits 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vannoordwijk1986"

\end_inset

, with the fittest lines able to increase fruit number, seed number and
 survival.
 This does not mean that variation in allocation strategy does not exist,
 simply that any trade-offs between traits are overwhelmed by variation
 in resource availability.
 We found only weak or non-significant correlations between fecundity and
 seed mass.
 It thus appears that investment in seed mass puts negligible constraint
 on fecundity in 
\emph on
A.
 thaliana 
\emph default
despite substantial variation in resource availability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
QTL analyses revealed that patterns of phenotypic variation in fecundity
 and its components are reflected in the genetic architecture of these traits.
 Of the loci with significant effects on each trait the local allele was
 associated with an increase in fecundity in all but one case (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:effect-sizes"

\end_inset

).
 This effect was clearer in Italy than Sweden, where fecundity contributes
 more strongly to fitness than in Sweden (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "agren_reciprocal_2012"

\end_inset

.
 It was also clearer for fruit number per plant than for seed number per
 fruit, refelecting the stronger selection observed on fruit number (figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:selection"

\end_inset

).
 Furthermore, the majority of loci with a significant effect on overall
 fecundity showed significant positive effects on both components of fecundity
 (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:effects-by-trait"

\end_inset

).
 This indicates that the positive relationships observed between phenotypes
 are reflected in the allelic effects of the underlying loci.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Combining data from multiple years in our QTL analyses provided substantial
 additional insight into the allelic effects of adpative loci.
 When we consider data for each experiment separately, most QTL clusters
 were only identified in a single experiment (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:QTL-cluster-positions"

\end_inset

, tables S5-7).
 Moreover, these analyses identifed evidence for trade-offs between sites
 at only three loci (F2:2, F5:5 and T5:4).
 When data for multiple years are combined we found that most loci have
 significant effects across years that are too subtle to be detected in
 any single year (figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:effect-sizes"

\end_inset

 and S4).
 This allowed us to identify three loci with significant trade-offs for
 fecundity and both components, and five additional loci with evidence for
 trade-offs for one or both components of fecundity.
 For those loci with no globally significant effect on fecundity or its
 components, the effect sizes are generally in the direction favouring the
 local allele (figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:effect-sizes"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:effects-by-trait"

\end_inset

).
 It is therefore likely that antagonistic pleiotropy makes a greater contributio
n to adpative differences between genotypes than our data imply, but that
 these effects are below the threshold of statistical significance.
 This general difficultly of detecting antagonistic pleiotropy has been
 noted for other systems 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

before "e.g. "
key "kawecki2004conceptual,anderson2013genetic"

\end_inset

.
 These data highlight the value of multi-year studies in evaluating the
 effects of QTL to the process of adaptation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that both fruit number per plant
 and seed number per fruit contribute to differences in fitness between
 local and non-local genotypes in 
\emph on
A.
 thaliana
\emph default
.
 We found no evidence for trade-offs between fecundity components, but rather
 that selection favours genotypes which are able to invest increased resources
 in across fitness traits.
 An interesting corollary of this finding is that it suggests that fecundity
 and survival traits are only the proximate causes of variation in fitness
 in a given environment, and that the ultimate driver of local adaptation
 is selection for some as-yet unmeasured trait related to resource use or
 efficiency.
 If true, this would suggest that the shared genetic basis among fecundity
 components and other traits 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "agren_genetic_2013"

\end_inset

 are in fact due to correlation with QTL for this putative trait.
 Nevertheless, an understadning of the proximate and ultimate causes of
 variation in fitness is vital to obtain a complete picture of the process
 of adaptation.
